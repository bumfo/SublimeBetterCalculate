Python Calculate
=========

This is a fork of [colinta/SublimeCalculate](https://github.com/colinta/SublimeCalculate). 

Instead of trying to be a calculator, this fork aims at creating an interactive python environment, like jupyter. 

All shared improvements go upstream, but this repo provides some unique support.
